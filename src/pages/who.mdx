### GAIA Home 
We are on a mission to create the first user controlled data platform 
for smart home device integration.

By giving the user total ownership of their data they can become more 
efficient in all aspects of their lives.  Having access to real time 
data of these devices ranging from infant care to personal health and 
organization, the user can now have a true assistant to provide support 
throughout every aspect of their lives.
