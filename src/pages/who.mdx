# Ryan, change this text. Here is how markdown works.
Use # to make headers. The more hastags the bigger the header.

### This is a smaller header

####### this is the smallest header
Typing with no hashtag gives you just plain paragraph text. 

Make a page here that explains who we are and our mission. Keep it short and too the point. 

If you want to make another page, create another .mdx file. It won't show up put it will still live here.

When you are done with your changes, open terminal. Drag the folder this lives in (gaia_docs) into terminal.

Then type git -am "a message about what you change".
Then type git push
